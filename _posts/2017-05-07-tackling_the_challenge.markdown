So far, I LOVE the problem solving aspect, I enjoy a challenge (something I felt my career in education is lacking) and having to work to find a solution.  There is such a great feeling of success when I can get all of the tests to pass.  Not to mention how the little bit I have completed so far is already helping me teach my students more about coding and trouble shooting.  

The other day in my classroom I had a student who was working on a free Intro to JavaScript lesson and had identified a variable within a method, but when he tried to use the variable in the next method it was giving him an error that the variable was not defined.  Before the Learn Bootcamp Prep and what I have completed so far, I would have just looked at other bits of code to find the differences and tried to help him fix the error by comparing his code to other examples (or I would have googled it)... This time, however, I was able to teach him about local and global variables and truely explain to him about varibles, then HE was able to tell me the solution that fixed his code.  It was a wonderful moment where I felt proud of my improving ability to teach my students about code to a level that they can identy their own errors instead of coming to ask for my help each time.

I have felt a little frustration because I have not had the time available to spend coding as much as I would like and I am not moving as fast as I know I can right now, but that is mostly do to the time of year.  There's 3 more weeks left of school and it is a busy time.  On top of that the FRC team I coach was invited to go to the world championships in Houston!  It was an amazing time and awesome experience, but it left me with NO time to code for about a week and a half.  Even though I wasn't able to work on my own learning of code through bootcamp, I did have some time to sit down with some wonderful teenagers to learn and work with them on the code for their robots.

I am very excited about the future coding challenges I will encounter and the job opportunities down the line that will continue to push and challenge me to learn more!
