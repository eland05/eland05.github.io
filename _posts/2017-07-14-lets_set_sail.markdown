So, the last couple of months have not gone as I planned, thus is life...  I have included my original draft of this blog entry from when it was due in May (#At a Stand Still), it is mostly just the venting of my frustration on not being able to focus solely on coding.  When I originally wrote the “Stand Still” entry I was looking forward to the month of June when I would have time to focus on bootcamp... HA! That did not happen, after a death in the family, planned vacation, training and professional development for my teaching job (which I will be returning to for another year) followed by another holiday with guest in town, I am finally able to get back into coding and completing the boot camp. Believe me, I tried through June to find time for coding, but there was too much. I know life never goes as planned and I am very grateful that I am healthy and finally able to get back into working on coding, the next blog entry will be about one on my coding projects... promise ;)

On a side note, I am working with my high school robotics students to develop their team webpage...
So I am putting to use some HTML/CSS knowledge to teach the kids something new, we learn together :)


## At a Stand Still

I should probably be talking about what I'm learning, but instead I'm going to end up writing about my frustrations with not having enough time to do the things I want to do, which is code.  I'm a teacher, it's the end of the school year and things are crazy! It seems like every other day there is an awards ceremony or some event I am having to attend. I know the end is near, but the last couple of weeks have left me feeling like there is no time for anything I want to do... I was hoping to be farther along by now, but the last couple of weeks I have barely made any progress.  I am frustrated. I was hoping to move through at a pace that I might have a chance of getting a new job before next school year, but here I am having to plan out things for next year.
