So now that I have gotten back into coding everyday, I have realized that I sometimes over complicate things. Working on iterations through arrays and hashes has shown me that sometimes I just overthink a little bit.  I understand the processes and the logic, but when it comes to writing the code I want to do several layers of #each when I just need to call up a certain key or value.  I need to remember to keep it simple and try with the easiest method first.
